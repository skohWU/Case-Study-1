%% In this script, you need to implement three functions as part of the k-means algorithm.
% These steps will be repeated until the algorithm converges:

  % 1. initialize_centroids
  % This function sets the initial values of the centroids
  
  % 2. assign_vector_to_centroid
  % This goes through the collection of all vectors and assigns them to
  % centroid based on norm/distance
  
  % 3. update_centroids
  % This function updates the location of the centroids based on the collection
  % of vectors (handwritten digits) that have been assigned to that centroid.


%% Initialize Data Set
% These next lines of code read in two sets of MNIST digits that will be used for training and testing respectively.

% training set (1500 images)
train=csvread('mnist_train_1500.csv');
trainsetlabels = train(:,785);
train=train(:,1:784);
train(:,785)=zeros(1500,1);

% testing set (200 images with 11 outliers)
test=csvread('mnist_test_200.csv');
% store the correct test labels
correctlabels = test(:,785);
test=test(:,1:784);

% now, zero out the labels in "test" so that you can use this to assign
% your own predictions and evaluate against "correctlabels"
% in the 'cs1_mnist_evaluate_test_set.m' script
test(:,785)=zeros(200,1);

%% After initializing, you will have the following variables in your workspace:
% 1. train (a 1500 x 785 array, containins the 1500 training images)
% 2. test (a 200 x 785 array, containing the 200 testing images)
% 3. correctlabels (a 200 x 1 array containing the correct labels (numerical
% meaning) of the 200 test images

%% To visualize an image, you need to reshape it from a 784 dimensional array into a 28 x 28 array.
% to do this, you need to use the reshape command, along with the transpose
% operation.  For example, the following lines plot the first test image

figure;
colormap('gray'); % this tells MATLAB to depict the image in grayscale
testimage = reshape(test(1,[1:784]), [28 28]);
% we are reshaping the first row of 'test', columns 1-784 (since the 785th
% column is going to be used for storing the centroid assignment.
imagesc(testimage'); % this command plots an array as an image.  Type 'help imagesc' to learn more.

%% After importing, the array 'train' consists of 1500 rows and 785 columns.
% Each row corresponds to a different handwritten digit (28 x 28 = 784)
% plus the last column, which is used to index that row (i.e., label which
% cluster it belongs to.  Initially, this last column is set to all zeros,
% since there are no clusters yet established.

%% This next section of code calls the three functions you are asked to specify

k = 23; % set k
max_iter = 200; % set the number of maximum potential iterations of the algorithm

%% The next line initializes the centroids.  Look at the initialize_centroids()
% function, which is specified further down this file.

centroids=initialize_centroids(train,k);

%% Initialize an array that will store k-means cost at each iteration

cost_iteration = zeros(max_iter, 1);

%% This for-loop enacts the k-means algorithm

for iter=1:max_iter
    total_cost = 0;
    for i = 1:size(train,1)
        [index, vec_distance] = assign_vector_to_centroid(train(i,:), centroids);
        train(i,785) = index;
        total_cost = total_cost + vec_distance;
    end
    cost_iteration(iter) = total_cost / length(train);

% Checks to see if there would be no change in centroid and stops
% iterating.

    if isequal(centroids, update_Centroids(train,k))
        break
    else
        centroids = update_Centroids(train,k);
    end
    
end

disp("Ended after " + iter + " iterations.");

%% Classifying Centroids

centroidLabels = zeros(k, 1);
for clusterIndex = 1:k
    clusterLabels = train(train(:,785) == clusterIndex, 785);
    if ~isempty(clusterLabels)
        centroidLabels(clusterIndex) = mode(trainsetlabels(train(:,785) == clusterIndex));
    end
    disp("Centroid " + clusterIndex + " corresponds to " + centroidLabels(clusterIndex))
end

save('classifierdata.mat', "centroids", "centroidLabels");

%% This section of code plots the k-means cost as a function of the number
% of iterations

figure;
cost_iteration = cost_iteration(cost_iteration ~= 0);
plot(1:iter, cost_iteration);


%% This next section of code will make a plot of all of the centroids
% Again, use help <functionname> to learn about the different functions
% that are being used here.

figure;
colormap('gray');

plotsize = ceil(sqrt(k));

for ind=1:k
    
    centr=centroids(ind,(1:784));
    subplot(plotsize,plotsize,ind);
    
    imagesc(reshape(centr,[28 28])');
    title(strcat('Centroid ',num2str(ind)))

end

%% Function to initialize the centroids
% This function randomly chooses k vectors from our training set and uses them to be our initial centroids
% There are other ways you might initialize centroids.
% ***Feel free to experiment.***
% Note that this function takes two inputs and emits one output (y).

function y=initialize_centroids(data,num_centroids)

random_index=randperm(size(data,1));

centroids=data(random_index(1:num_centroids),:);

y=centroids;

end

%% Function to pick the Closest Centroid using norm/distance
% This function takes two arguments, a vector and a set of centroids
% It returns the index of the assigned centroid and the distance between
% the vector and the assigned centroid.

function [index, vec_distance] = assign_vector_to_centroid(data,centroids)

    num_centroids = size(centroids, 1);
    distances = zeros(num_centroids: 1);
    
    for i = 1:num_centroids
        distances(i) = norm(data(1:784) - centroids(i, (1:784)));
    end
    
    [vec_distance, index] = min(distances);

end


%% Function to compute new centroids using the mean of the vectors currently assigned to the centroid.
% This function takes the set of training images and the value of k.
% It returns a new set of centroids based on the current assignment of the
% training images.

function new_centroids=update_Centroids(data,k)

    new_centroids = zeros(k, size(data, 2) - 1);
    
    for i = 1:k
        assinged_vectors = data(data(:, 785) == i, 1:784);
    
        if ~isempty(assinged_vectors)
            new_centroids(i, 1:end) = mean(assinged_vectors, 1);
        end
    end
